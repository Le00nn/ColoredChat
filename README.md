# ColoredChat

### What is this?
ColoredChat is a plugin made for Project Poseidon Uberbukkit (a fork of Craftbukkit).
This plugin overrides the PlayerChatEvent and prevents your default message from being sent and instead broadcasts an edited version with coloring applied.
Any use of other plugins altering chat through the PlayerChatEvent may hinder this plugin from functioning as intended!
